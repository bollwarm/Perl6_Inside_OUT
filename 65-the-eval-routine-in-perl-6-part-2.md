Welcome back! As you might notice, there was a small gap in the daily post flow.

Before we are back to the Rakudo internals, a couple of words about some changes here. First of all, every post is now marked with eitherÂ ðŸ¦‹Â orÂ ðŸ”¬Â (or with indistinguishable rectangles â–¡ if your browser cannot display an emoji :-). These characters mean two categories of posts here: a butterfly stands for [Perl 6 syntax][1], while a microscope is for [Perl 6 internals][2]. In the first category, only user-level aspects or Perl 6 are discussed. In the second, we dig into the source codes of Rakudo. All the past post are updated accordingly.

The second change is that I will occasionally post more articles in the Perl 6 syntax category because I found out that non-Russian speakers often like my [Russian blog posts][3]. Those posts are mostly short texts explaining interesting features of Perl 6, such as the =~= operator or promises.

OK, now we have to talk about theÂ EVAL routine. It is defined in the src/core/ForeignCode.pm file as a multi-function. Let us see at their signatures:

	proto sub EVAL($code is copy where Blob|Cool,
	               Str() :$lang = 'perl6',
	               PseudoStash :$context, *%n)

	multi sub EVAL($code,
	               Str :$lang where { ($lang // '') eq 'Perl5' },
	               PseudoStash :$context)

Notice that one of the function is a [proto][4], while another is the only multi-candidate. Unlike many other cases that you can see in the sources of Rakudo, this proto routine contains code. Refer to [one of the recent blog posts][5] to see how it works.

We start with an example from the [first part][6] of the article.

	EVAL('say 123');

Here, the passed value isÂ Str, and it is caught by the proto sub, as its first argument can beÂ Cool.

The sub creates a compiler for the given language (which is Perl 6 by default).

	my $compiler := nqp::getcomp($lang);

The next step in the sub is to make a _string_ out ofÂ $code. In this first example, this task is trivial.

	$code = nqp::istype($code,Blob) ?? $code.decode(
	    $compiler.cli-options&lt;encoding&gt; // 'utf8'
	) !! $code.Str;

Finally, the string is compiled:

	my $compiled := $compiler.compile:
	    $code,
	    :outer_ctx($eval_ctx),
	    :global(GLOBAL),
	    :mast_frames(mast_frames),
	    |(:optimize($_) with nqp::getcomp('perl6').cli-options&lt;optimize&gt;),
	    |(%(:grammar($LANG&lt;MAIN&gt;), :actions($LANG&lt;MAIN-actions&gt;)) if $LANG);

After compilation, you get an object of theÂ ForeignCode type. This class is a child class ofÂ Callable, so the object can be called and returned (actually, itâ€™s not quite clear how it happens):

	$compiled();

Now you can understand that single quotes in the second example with curly braces still create an executable code:

	EVAL('say {456}');

Here, the whole string is compiled as it was a Perl 6 code, and the code block there is a code block, which Perl should execute, and thusÂ sayÂ gets a code block, so it calls itsÂ [gist method][7] to prepare the output:

	&gt; {456}.gist
	**-&gt; ;; $_? is raw { #`(Block|140388575216888) ... }**
