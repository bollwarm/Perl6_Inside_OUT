A new release of Rakudo was just announced. Most of the changes increase Perl 6 performance this time. Let us briefly look at some of them.

I am happy to tell that my blog initiated at least two of the changes.

### Removed UInt64 (not to be confused with uint64) [[cf154355][1]]

We’ve seen this class in the post [about native integers][2]. The UInt64 type remained in the codebase for a long time while it was not actually used. The uint type, though, is still to-be-used as the type of the denominator in Rats:

	# XXX: should be Rational[Int, uint]
	my class Rat is Cool does Rational[Int, Int] {

### Made DateTime creation about 1.6x faster [[36d71a39][3]]

As we saw, the DateTime constructor [used the in-range method][4], which was replaced with faster explicit tests:

	- (1..12).in-range($month,'Month');
	- (1 .. self.DAYS-IN-MONTH($year,$month)).in-range($day,'Day');
	- (0..23).in-range($hour,'Hour');
	- (0..59).in-range($minute,'Minute');

	+ **1 &lt;= $month &lt;= 12**
	+     || X::OutOfRange.new(:what&lt;Month&gt;,:got($month),:range&lt;1..12&gt;).throw;
	+ **1 &lt;= $day &lt;= self.DAYS-IN-MONTH($year,$month)**
	+     || X::OutOfRange.new(
	+         :what&lt;Day&gt;,
	+         :got($day),
	+         :range("1..{self.DAYS-IN-MONTH($year,$month)}")
	+     ).throw;
	+ **0 &lt;= $hour &lt;= 23**
	+     || X::OutOfRange.new(:what&lt;Hour&gt;,:got($hour),:range&lt;0..23&gt;).throw;
	+ **0 &lt;= $minute &lt;= 59**
	+     || X::OutOfRange.new(:what&lt;Minute&gt;,:got($minute),:range&lt;0..59&gt;).throw;

### Made adding integers to Rats 22% faster [[418fc068][5]]

Creating Rats is an interesting procedure, which I am going to blog about in the future. For now, let me show the changes from this commit:

	sub DON'T_DIVIDE_NUMBERS(Int:D \nu, Int:D \de, $t1, $t2) {

	-     my $r;
	-     if nqp::istype($t1, FatRat) || nqp::istype($t2, FatRat) {
	-         **$r := nqp::create(FatRat);**
	-         nqp::bindattr($r, FatRat, '$!numerator', nqp::decont(nu));
	-         nqp::bindattr($r, FatRat, '$!denominator', nqp::decont(de));
	-     } else {
	-         $r := nqp::create(Rat);
	-         nqp::bindattr($r, Rat, '$!numerator', nqp::decont(nu));
	-         nqp::bindattr($r, Rat, '$!denominator', nqp::decont(de));
	-     }
	-     $r;

	+     nqp::istype($t1, FatRat) || nqp::istype($t2, FatRat)
	+         ?? **nqp::p6bindattrinvres**(
	+                nqp::p6bindattrinvres(
	+                    nqp::create(FatRat),
	+                    FatRat, '$!numerator', nqp::decont(nu)),
	+                FatRat, '$!denominator', nqp::decont(de))
	+         !! nqp::p6bindattrinvres(
	+                nqp::p6bindattrinvres(
	+                    nqp::create(Rat),
	+                    Rat, '$!numerator', nqp::decont(nu)),
	+                Rat, '$!denominator', nqp::decont(de))

This is a routine that is a part of creating a Rat value from two integers. A Rat value internally contains two attributes, the numerator and the denominator. They were bound via the nqp::bindattr method with the help of some temporary variable. Now the Rakudo’s nqp::p6bindattrinvres method is used directly. This method is equivalent to the following code (see docs/ops.markdown in the Rakudo directory):

	{
	    bindattr($obj, $type, $attr-name, $value);
	    $obj;
	}

### Made use of faster typechecks (7.5x faster) [[4c9b84f8][6]]\[[8f71b0e0][7]]\[[10cd405f][8]]

The key idea of this change is to replace the Perl 6 type checks with NQP ones, all changes are in src/Perl6/Actions.nqp, for example:

	- if $past.**isa**(QAST::Var) {
	+ if nqp::istype($past, QAST::Var) {

	- if $elem **~~** QAST::Op
	+ if nqp::istype($elem, QAST::Op)

As a useful exercise, you can trace back the behaviour of both .isa and ~~ in the code and see why it could slow down the check.

### Made operator chains up to 2.4x faster [[b77d8756][9]]

The change was made in src/Perl6/Optimizer.nqp, and we are not going to read it here, but I wanted to mention this change because it is relevant to a small but very handy feature of Perl 6, chain comparisons such as 1 &lt; $x &lt; 2. It is claimed that now it works almost as fast as 1 &lt; $x &amp;&amp; $x &lt; 2.

### Made .sum on 2-element Lists about 30% faster [[0af3f4d1][10]]

This is an interesting change in the code that, basically, avoids using a loop for adding up two values:

	- nqp::stmts(
	-   (my $list := $!reified),
	-   (my $sum = nqp::ifnull(nqp::atpos($list,0),0)),
	-   (my int $i),
	-   **nqp::while**(
	-     nqp::islt_i($i = nqp::add_i($i,1),$elems),
	-     ($sum = $sum + nqp::ifnull(nqp::atpos($list,$i),0))

	+ nqp::if(
	+   **nqp::isgt_i($elems,2)**,
	+   nqp::stmts(
	+     (my $list := $!reified),
	+     (my $sum = nqp::ifnull(nqp::atpos($list,0),0)),
	+     (my int $i),
	+     **nqp::while**(
	+       nqp::islt_i($i = nqp::add_i($i,1),$elems),
	+       ($sum = $sum + nqp::ifnull(nqp::atpos($list,$i),0))
	+     ),
	+     $sum

A lot of NQP code here in src/core/List.pm, but you can understand it if I tell you that nqp::stmts makes a sequence of statements a single statement. Thus, the nqp::isgt\_i check has two branches: for arrays that either have one or two, or arrays with more elements.

There are more interesting changes but most of them require deeper understanding of Rakudo.
