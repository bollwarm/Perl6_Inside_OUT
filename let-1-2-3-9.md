Is it easy to break the behaviour of Perl 6? Well, the answer probably depends on what exactly you want to break.

Playing with [operator precedence][1], I wanted to change the rules of arithmetical operators + and \* so that they are executed in different order, namely, multiplication first, addition second.

Sounds like an easy task. Go to src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp and change a couple of lines that set the precedence of the + and \* infixes:

	- token infix:sym&lt;*&gt;    { &lt;sym&gt; &lt;O(|%multiplicative)&gt; }
	+ token infix:sym&lt;*&gt;    { &lt;sym&gt; &lt;O(|%additive)&gt; }
	. . .
	- token infix:sym&lt;+&gt;    { &lt;sym&gt; &lt;O(|%additive)&gt; }
	+ token infix:sym&lt;+&gt;    { &lt;sym&gt; &lt;O(|%multiplicative)&gt; }

Ready? Compile!

Recompiling the grammar takes a long time, so at first it looks promising, but after a few seconds, the compilation stops with an error:

	**Month out of range. Is: -935111296, should be in 1..12**

	Makefile:517: recipe for target 'perl6-m' failed
	make: *** [perl6-m] Error 1

Month out of range?? Oh, we changed the rules of the Universe and before Perl 6 is even compiled, the new rules of arithmetics are already applied.

OK, letâ€™s add some anaesthesia and suppress the error message. The code that checks for the correct month value is located in src/core/DateTime.pm, namely, inside the DateTime constructor. Comment that line out:

	method !new-from-positional(DateTime:
	    Int() $year,
	    Int() $month,
	    Int() $day,
	    Int() $hour,
	    Int() $minute,
	        $second,
	        %extra,
	    :$timezone = 0,
	    :&amp;formatter,
	) {
	    **# (1..12).in-range($month,'Month');**
	    (1 .. self.DAYS-IN-MONTH($year,$month)).in-range($day,'Day');
	    (0..23).in-range($hour,'Hour');
	    (0..59).in-range($minute,'Minute');
	    (^61).in-range($second,'Second');
	    . . .

This time, the month range check doesnâ€™t stop us from going further but another error breaks in:

	MVMArray: Index out of bounds

	Makefile:517: recipe for target 'perl6-m' failed
	make: *** [perl6-m] Error 1

Looks cryptic. MVMArray is a MoarVM array, obviously. So, we not only broke Perl 6 but MoarVM, too. Letâ€™s go fix it.

The sources of MoarVM are located in a separate git repository at nqp/MoarVM. The message we saw can be found inÂ nqp/MoarVM/src/6model/reprs/VMArray.c:

	if (index &lt; 0)
	Â  Â  MVM_exception_throw_adhoc(tc, "MVMArray: Index out of bounds");

There are two places like that, so letâ€™s not guess which of them we need and preventatively change both of them to the following:

	if (index &lt; 0)
	Â  Â  index = 0;
	Â  Â  // MVM_exception_throw_adhoc(tc, "MVMArray: Index out of bounds");

(This is C, not Perl.)

From nqp/MoarVM, compile and re-install MoarVM and later try compiling Rakudo:

	~/rakudo/nqp/MoarVM$ make
	~/rakudo/nqp/MoarVM$ make install

	~/rakudo/nqp/MoarVM$ cd ../..
	~/rakudo$ make

This time, the error pops up immediately (as no NQP files are compiled):

	Use of Nil in numeric context

	Use of Nil in numeric context

	Day out of range. Is: -51, should be in 1..0

	Makefile:517: recipe for target 'perl6-m' failed
	make: *** [perl6-m] Error 1

It looks like we can ignore Nils at the moment, but the DateTime hurts us again. We know the remedy:

	# (1..12).in-range($month,'Month');
	**# (1 .. self.DAYS-IN-MONTH($year,$month)).in-range($day,'Day');**

Yahoo! This time, the compilation process was calm and we got a newÂ perl6 executable, which works as we wanted:

	$ ./perl6 -e'say 1+2*3'
	9

Donâ€™t forget to restore the files before further experiments with Perl 6 ðŸ™‚

### Update

In the comment to this blog post, you can see a reference to the [commit][2], which changes the way Rakudo checks the validity of the DateTime object. Instead of using the in-rangeÂ method, simpler checks are used now, for example:

	1 &lt;= $month &lt;= 12
	Â  Â  || X::OutOfRange.new(:what&lt;Month&gt;,:got($month),:range&lt;1..12&gt;).throw;

Here are the time measures of the two runs of a loop creating DateTime objects before and after the update:

	time ./perl6 -e'DateTime.new(2018,1,5,12,30,0) for ^500000'
	real **0m7.261s**
	user 0m7.276s
	sys 0m0.020s

	. . .

	$ time ./perl6 -e'DateTime.new(2018,1,5,12,30,0) for ^500000'
	real **0m4.457s**
	user 0m4.476s
	sys 0m0.012s
