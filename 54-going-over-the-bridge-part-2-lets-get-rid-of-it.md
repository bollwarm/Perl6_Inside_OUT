Today, we continue working with the Bridge method in Rakudo Perl 6. [Yesterday][1], we saw the definitions of the methods in a few pre-defined data types. It is time to see how the method is used.

![Bridge][2]

## Whatâ€™s inside?

The major use of the method is inside theÂ Real role, which contains the following set of methods:

	method sqrt() { self.Bridge.sqrt }
	method rand() { self.Bridge.rand }
	method sin() { self.Bridge.sin }
	method asin() { self.Bridge.asin }
	method cos() { self.Bridge.cos }
	method acos() { self.Bridge.acos }
	method tan() { self.Bridge.tan }
	method atan() { self.Bridge.atan }
	. . .
	method sec() { self.Bridge.sec }
	method asec() { self.Bridge.asec }
	method cosec() { self.Bridge.cosec }
	method acosec() { self.Bridge.acosec }
	method cotan() { self.Bridge.cotan }
	method acotan() { self.Bridge.acotan }
	method sinh() { self.Bridge.sinh }
	method asinh() { self.Bridge.asinh }
	method cosh() { self.Bridge.cosh }
	method acosh() { self.Bridge.acosh }
	method tanh() { self.Bridge.tanh }
	method atanh() { self.Bridge.atanh }
	method sech() { self.Bridge.sech }
	method asech() { self.Bridge.asech }
	method cosech() { self.Bridge.cosech }
	method acosech() { self.Bridge.acosech }
	method cotanh() { self.Bridge.cotanh }
	method acotanh() { self.Bridge.acotanh }
	method floor() { self.Bridge.floor }
	method ceiling() { self.Bridge.ceiling }
	. . .
	multi method log(Real:D: ) { self.Bridge.log }
	multi method exp(Real:D: ) { self.Bridge.exp }

There are a few routines with a different pattern, where the method is called twice: once for getting to the needed function; second to coerce the value:

	multi method atan2(Real $x = 1e0) { self.Bridge.atan2($x.Bridge) }
	multi method atan2(Cool $x = 1e0) { self.Bridge.atan2($x.Numeric.Bridge) }
	multi method atan2(Real $x = 1e0) { self.Bridge.atan2($x.Bridge) }
	multi method atan2(Cool $x = 1e0) { self.Bridge.atan2($x.Numeric.Bridge) }
	multi method log(Real:D: Real $base) { self.Bridge.log($base.Bridge) }
	. . .
	multi sub atan2(Real \a, Real \b = 1e0) { a.Bridge.atan2(b.Bridge) }

As you see, theÂ atan2 function is defined both as a method and as a subroutine. To confuse you a bit more, there are two versions of it:

	proto sub atan2($, $?) {*}
	multi sub atan2(Real \a, Real \b = 1e0) { a.Bridge.atan2(b.Bridge) }
	# should really be (Cool, Cool), and then (Cool, Real) and (Real, Cool)
	# candidates, but since Int both conforms to Cool and Real, we'd get lots
	# of ambiguous dispatches. So just go with (Any, Any) for now.
	multi sub atan2( \a, \b = 1e0) { a.Numeric.atan2(b.Numeric) }

Finally, a couple of methods for type conversions:

	method Bridge(Real:D:) { self.Num }
	method Int(Real:D:) { self.Bridge.Int }
	method Num(Real:D:) { self.Bridge.Num }
	multi method Str(Real:D:) { self.Bridge.Str }
	method Rat(Real:D: Real $epsilon = 1.0e-6) { self.Bridge.Rat($epsilon) }

Notice that theÂ Bridge method of theÂ _Real_ role returns a _Num_Â value.

Some infix methods are also using the method in hand:

	multi sub infix:&lt;+&gt;(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge + b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:&lt;-&gt;(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge - b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:&lt;*&gt;(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge * b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:&lt;/&gt;(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge / b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:&lt;%&gt;(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge % b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:&lt;**&gt;(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge ** b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:Â«&lt;=&gt;Â»(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge &lt;=&gt; b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:&lt;==&gt;(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge == b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:Â«&lt;Â»(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge &lt; b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:Â«&lt;=Â»(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge &lt;= b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:Â«â‰¤Â» (Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge â‰¤ b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:Â«&gt;Â»(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge &gt; b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:Â«&gt;=Â»(Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge &gt;= b.Bridge }
	multi sub infix:Â«â‰¥Â» (Real \a, Real \b) { a.Bridge â‰¥ b.Bridge }
	multi sub prefix:&lt;-&gt;(Real:D \a) { -a.Bridge }

## Trace the calls

To see when theÂ BridgeÂ method is called, let us do a few simple experiments. I added a fewÂ nqp::say calls and run the REPL console to invoke aÂ sin method on the variables of different types.

With theÂ Num data type, a direct method is called:

	&gt; my **Num** $n = 1e1;
	10
	&gt; $n.sin
	**Num.sin**

This method is calling the underlying NQP function:

	proto method sin(|) {*}
	multi method sin(Num:D: ) {
	    nqp::p6box_n(nqp::sin_n(nqp::unbox_n(self)));
	}

With other data types, you travel via theÂ Real role:

	&gt; my **Int** $i = 1;
	1
	&gt; $i.sin
	**Real.sin**
	**Num.sin**

	&gt; my **Rat** $r = 1/2;
	0.5
	&gt; $r.sin
	**Real.sin**
	**Num.sin**

The same path you experience with your own types, if they are inherited from the built-in ones:

	&gt; class MyInt is Int {}
	&gt; my **MyInt** $mi = MyInt.new
	0
	&gt; $mi.sin
	**Real.sin**
	**Num.sin**

## Get rid of it

I [revised all the places][3] where the method was used in my clone of Rakudo. Mostly, they are replaced with a direct call of theÂ Num method. In a few places it leads to double calls like $x.Num.Num, which were also reduced, of course.

With the updated code, all the tests from Roast were passed. As a side effect, the speed in some cases is increased by around 3%:

	./perl6 -e'for 1..10_000_000 {Int.new(1).sin}'

It is quite an extensive change, and still, there is one thing left: the thing that causes [an infinite loop when you call the method on a newly created Real object][4]. It looks like the wrong hierarchy of the numerical data types is the main cause, but I assume that we can safely remove theÂ BridgeÂ method at least.

**Update.** They core developers (although at first not clearly understanding why it the method was needed at all) decided to keep the method and [updated the documentation][5], which is also a positive output ðŸ™‚
